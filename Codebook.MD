Data Dictionary - Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones


The data contained in the "output.txt" file is a 180 row by 68 column table in wide format. Each entry corresponds to the mean value (columns 3-68) of a variable for a set of measurements taken for the performance of each activity by each participant.  For a description of the raw data and the transformations and clean up performed, please see the README.MD.

The column descriptions are numbered 1-68 in this codebook and are as follows:  

1 Activity_Label
Character string : Factor containing six levels that characterize the type activity the subject was performing.  Levels are:
1 WALKING
2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4 SITTING
5 STANDING
6 LAYING
The text values were used to replace the activity codes in the original using the mapping above


2 Subject_ID
Integer : Factor with 30 levels that uniquely identify each of 30 participants in the study. Possible values are 1-30


The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The measures were as follows: 
tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

For each measure, the mean and standard deviation were extracted and then the mean of each of those was calculated for each activity performed by each participant.  They are listed in columns 3-68.  All values are numeric data that lies in the range -1 to 1.
